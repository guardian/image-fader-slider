Constructed over seven years by engineers Sir John Fowler (1817-1898) and Sir Benjamin Baker (1840-1907) and completed in 1890, it was the largest steel bridge of its time.<br /><br />Thanks to a recent coat of extremely weather-resistant paint, the bridge is now free of painters and scaffolding for the first time since it was built.</div><div class="credit">Photographs: SSPL/Getty and Murdo MacLeod for The Observer</div>
